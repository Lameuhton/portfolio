  "Section2Description": "Interested in computers since childhood, I have explored its various aspects for years, but it's in web development that I found my path. Always seeking improvement, I enjoy learning new languages/frameworks. I'm also fortunate to start a 3-month internship at Webecode in Li√®ge in early September.",
  "Section2Tab1": "I studied Management IT and Cybersecurity (HEPL and Helmo), but the traditional study method did not suit me. I discovered BeCode, which offers an active pedagogical approach with practical projects similar to the professional world, in groups or individually. This method allowed me to learn quickly and improve my skills. We recently finished an e-commerce site project and I started learning Wordpress with ACF",
